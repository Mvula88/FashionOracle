# ðŸš€ Quick Start: Getting Your First API Key (Twitter)

Since Twitter/X API is the easiest to obtain, let's start there!

## Step 1: Get Twitter API Access (5 minutes)

3. **Describe Your Use**
   ```
   I'm building Fashion Oracle, a platform that analyzes fashion trends
   by monitoring public tweets about fashion, style, and clothing.
   The app will:
   - Search for fashion-related hashtags
   - Analyze engagement on fashion content
   - Track emerging style trends
   - No automated posting or user interaction
   ```

4. **Get Your Bearer Token**
   - Once approved (usually instant for basic access)
   - Go to your app â†’ "Keys and tokens"
   - Copy the "Bearer Token"

## Step 2: Add to Fashion Oracle

### Option A: Add to Supabase Dashboard (Production)
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ifyyxkwwmnbokjbqgsmi/settings/vault
2. Click "New secret"
3. Add:
   - Name: `TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN`
   - Value: `your-bearer-token-here`

### Option B: Test Locally First
1. Open `supabase/functions/.env`
2. Add your token:
   ```env
   TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmlheaAAAAA...
   ```

## Step 3: Test It!

Run this command to test Twitter data collection:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/collect-social-data \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImlmeXl4a3d3bW5ib2tqYnFnc21pIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTUxNzg2OTUsImV4cCI6MjA3MDc1NDY5NX0.to23KV-wt2NknukM-Zbz-RShKyyZIpwC2DqJqIKgbHA" \
